# AMP (Anticipatory Music Production) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/angathorion/amp-online.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/angathorion/amp-online)

## Purpose

This project is the development of a system enabling musicians to perform anticipatory music production in Western music
notation. The essential idea is to give musicians the ability to input music using MIDI devices at any point in the
score during playback, at the same time broadcasting the produced score to the partner in the same performance. By
enabling anticipatory input, the musician can let the partner know and anticipate their intentions for the music, so as
to shape the music in a coherent fashion.

The development of this project, as well as a research undertaking involving user testing with a number of musicians,
is intended to probe the potential that Western music notation may have on anticipatory music production, as well as
improvisation.
